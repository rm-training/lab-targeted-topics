/*
 * Read the index.html file and locate all of the elements that have
 * text content containing the word "FLAG" followed by a number ("#1",
 * "#2", etc.)
 *
 * Using the standard DOM methods, move these elements into the `ul'
 * element that is inside the `div' with the ID of `#bucket'.  Move
 * the entire element, not just the text content.  Ensure you maintain
 * proper HTML structure by enclosing the FLAG elements in `li'
 * elements when necessary.
 *
 * The FLAG elements in the `ul' should be listed in ascending
 * (numeric) order.
 *
 * Tips:
 *
 * Move them one at a time.  Some of them will have to be moved by
 * selecting a parent element and then using the traversal methods to
 * find the correct FLAG element.
 *
 * Hint: you can use:
 *
 *   - getElementById
 *     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById
 *
 *   - getElementsByTagName
 *     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getElementsByTagName
 *
 *   - getElementsByClassName
 *     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassName
 *
 *   - querySelector
 *     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector
 *
 *   - querySelectorAll
 *     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll
 *
 *   - createElement
 *     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement
 *
 *   - appendChild
 *     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild
 *
 * and all the parent, child and sibling selectors, along with the DOM
 * traversal properties such as:
 *
 *   - parentNode
 *   - previousSibling
 *   - nextSibling
 *   - firstChild
 *   - lastChild
 *   - childNodes
 *
 * Which you can read about here:
